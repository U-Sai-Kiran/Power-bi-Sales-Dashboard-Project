# Power-bi-Sales-Dashboard-Project
This project involves developing a dynamic sales dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to provide actionable insights into sales performance. The dashboard includes features such as an overview of key sales metrics, regional and product-level analysis, customer segmentation, and time-based trends. It integrates data from various sources including sales databases and CRM systems, using Power BI Desktop for design and Power BI Service for sharing. Users can interact with the dashboard through filters and slicers to explore data, monitor KPIs, and make data-driven decisions.
